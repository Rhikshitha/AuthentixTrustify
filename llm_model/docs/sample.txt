Buddhism also known as Bauddha Dharma, and Dharmavinaya (transl. "doctrines and disciplines"), is an Indian religion and philosophical tradition based on teachings attributed to the Buddha.[4] It originated in the eastern Gangetic plain as a śramaṇa–movement in the 5th century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia via the Silk Road. It is the world's fourth-largest religion,[5][6] with over 520 million followers (Buddhists) who comprise seven percent of the global population.
